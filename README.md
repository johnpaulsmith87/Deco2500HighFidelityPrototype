# Deco2500HighFidelityPrototype
Respository for DECO2500 final report

Follow the workflow guide found here: (https://guides.github.com/pdfs/githubflow-online.pdf)

You'll need both Visual Studio 2017 and the .NET Core SDK (https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows)

For the layout/styles, I'd recommend sticking to CSS Grids (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp)
and/or Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/)

## PLEASE ENSURE YOUR MONITOR'S RESOLUTION IS SET TO 1920 x 1080 AND CHROME ZOOM TO 67%
